                  What is the legal basis for processing your data?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The legal basis for the processing of your personal data for
                  the purposes detailed in section a) is Iberdrola's legitimate
                  interest in the creation of a network of contacts for the
                  development and maintenance of public relations and/or
                  networking with its stakeholders, as well as for the exchange
                  of opinions on matters related to its business project and
                  social responsibility strategy, for the purpose of
                  contributing to the development of the communities in which it
                  operates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The legal basis for processing your personal data for the
                  purpose indicated in section b), once you have requested to
                  take part in the event in question by registering for it, is
                  Iberdrola’s legitimate interest in appropriately managing and
                  holding said event so that it can take place safely and all
                  attendees can properly take part in it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, the legal basis for the processing provided for
                  in section c) is Iberdrola’s legitimate interest in ensuring
                  the safety of its facilities and of the individuals and assets
                  found therein.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of purpose d), the legal basis varies depending on
                  the type of image:
                </p>
                <p>
                  - When these are general images and background sound, the
                  legal basis for processing your personal data is Iberdrola’s
                  legitimate interest in advertising and promoting the IBERDROLA
                  image and brand, both internally and externally, so as to make
                  the company and the group to which it belongs better known and
                  to paint a public picture of IBERDROLA and the people linked
                  to it that is in keeping with the ideals and values that
                  govern its activity, through the publication of the activities
                  and events it organises.
                </p>
                <p>
                  - In the event that, as part of collecting images during the
                  holding of the above-mentioned events, IBERDROLA, either
                  directly or through the third parties hired for this purpose,
                  captures images in which it is possible to directly recognise–
                  close-ups –, the processing of the images and voices of the
                  attendees has its legal basis in the consent that they gave to
                  attend the event, which includes or may include the
                  international transfer of data to a third country, which
                  implies certain risks to their privacy due to the absence of a
                  legal adaptation decision and appropriate guarantees. By
                  attending the event, you are authorising this transfer of
                  image rights free of charge for use both in currently known
                  technical media and any that may be developed in the future
                  for a period of 2 years and with no geographical limitation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the case of purpose e), the legal basis is Iberdrola’s
                  legitimate interest in understanding the opinion and degree of
                  satisfaction of event attendees with the aim of implementing a
                  continuing improvement process for events.
                </p>
                <h3 class="my-4">How long will we keep your data?</h3>
                <p>
                  We will keep your personal data for access to the facility and
                  the management of the event until it ends. Your image or voice
                  in any audiovisual clips will be retained unless and until you
                  express an objection to their use, or withdraw your consent,
                  as indicated in the section on legitimising bases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you exercise your right of opposition or withdraw your
                  consent, the images in which you appear will be immediately
                  deleted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Nevertheless, when the above deadlines pass, said images will
                  be duly locked and stored until the statute of limitations
                  expires for any potential liabilities related to the
                  processing thereof
                </p>
                <h3 class="my-4">Who will receive your data?</h3>
                <p>
                  Your data will be communicated to other Iberdrola group
                  companies for internal administration purposes, or in the case
                  of some events, for publication on the websites of other
